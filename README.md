### About the project

This site allows you to buy items from the shopping cart, and on the shopping cart, there's an option to put
a discount code (Doesen't need to click "Apply") which it can lower the cost of the purchase.

What doesn't work here: The amount of products left on stock isn't being updated (therefore you can always add the same product type) & i'm not fetching these data from the external API.

I mean, i did fetch from the external API, you can see when it doesn't work when there's an alert on screen saying
that the API wasen't reached, but i didn't know how to adapt it into my code.

All the other stuff works.

I didn't imagine that this backend job test would require a good use of my front-end skills, so that's the most that i could do within this time limit. C'est Ã§a.
